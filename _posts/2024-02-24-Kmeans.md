## Introduction
Data used to be so easy to classify. In a pre-computer era, people were the ones collecting information and the information had context.
Using this context, statisticians and researchers a like had no trouble interpreting it and finding useful patterns. Then came automatic collection 
mechanisms.

Computers have provided us with many new ways of obtaining data. Some of this data, doesn't make sense to humans and is more difficult to interpret. 
If only there was a way to identify relationships between variables perfectly... Unfortunately, no such sorcery exists. However, there is an algorithm
that can be used to obtain fairly solid guesses.

## K-means: What is it?
K-means clustering is an algorithm used by data scientists to establish meaningful labels for data points. The algorithm works by selecting k random
points (k indicates how many groups we want to create at the end, for purposes of this explanation, k has arbitrarily been chosen as 3).
These three random points will serve as the starting reference values. The computer will then go through and assess the distance between every data point
and these three points. It will then assign the point to the nearest reference point. After this, the mean of each of the groups will be discovered. The
computer will then go through each point again and see if the groups have changed. Once no points have changed groups after an iteration, the computer
will find the total variance of the groups and will save the reference points.

Obviously, this is not guaranteed to find the best clusters. As such the computer will run this algorithm a determined 'n' times. At the end of the trials,
the computer will select the reference points with the lowest total variance and will return the clusters associated with those points. Clearly, this still
is not guaranteed to find the best clusters. Given that this algorithm is NP-hard, it makes the most sense to be satisfied with a heuristic solution, specifically
the one that is returned from the process above.

Wikipedia has a very detailed article about this algorithm. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">Click here to get a more technical and in-depth explanation</a>

This algorithm is fairly easy to use with python's Scikit learn library.
<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html" target="_blank">The documentation for which can be found here</a>
Most learning is best done by doing! As such, let's walk through how to use this powerful tool.

# Tutorial
## Setting up the environment
To start, it is important to make sure you have all of the dependencies installed. For purposes of this tutorial (and for data science uses more generally)
you will want to install the following dependencies:
* numpy
* statsmodels.api
* matplotlib
* sklearn

These libraries have many more uses than what we will be using them for today. If you dont have one or more of these dependencies installed, the University
of Michigan has released and excellent tutorial on multiple ways to do this. <a href="https://docs.support.arc.umich.edu/python/pkgs_envs/" target="_blank">Click here to access that tutorial</a>
Once this has been done, we can now begin importing these into python. This can be done with the following code:

```{python}
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
```

If you encounter any errors or issues with importing these libraries, please look above at the University of Michigan tutorial and attempt to redownload 
each of the dependencies.

## Importing the data set
The following lines of code aren't completely necessary for when you use it on your on data. The important thing is to have a dataframe which includes the
data that you want to run the algorithm on. These lines of code import the 'Iris' dataset. This is a very common dataset in data science which includes
information about flowers. The second line of code pulls all of the values from the data set and the first four columns.

```{python}
df = sm.datasets.get_rdataset(dataname='iris', package='datasets').data
X = df.iloc[:, :4].values
```

To check if the dataframe was correctly created, run the following lines of code to get a plot of the data

```{python}
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1])
plt.title("Iris")
```

Your plot should look something like this:
<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/baseplot.png" alt="" style="width:300px;"/>

## Running Kmeans
Running the Kmeans algorithm on this data can be done super simply. Run the following lines of code to run the algorithm and then plot the results.

```{python}
kiris = KMeans(n_clusters = 3, n_init = 'auto').fit(X)

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kiris.labels_)
plt.title("Iris Kmeans")
```

After running the algorithm and plotting, you should get a plot that looks like this:
<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/irisplot.png" alt="" style="width:300px;"/>

If you had any trouble with running any of the code above, please make sure that python and the dependencies are correctly installed. If all else fails,
try copying and pasting the error with the code into ChatGPT and ask what may have caused the error. Usually it can give pretty good advice.

## Conclusion
K-means is a very powerful and useful algorithm. It is super easy to use with scikit learn and has many applications. For your own dataset, you will likely
want to consult the documentation under the k-means section of this blog post. There you will find many parameters you could try for your own specific 
situation.
